# Autonomous Roadside Assistance Drone System

## Overview
This repository contains the code for an innovative autonomous roadside assistance system utilizing drones to provide rapid and accurate vehicle diagnostics and maintenance. The system leverages advanced technologies such as real-time data processing, machine learning, and automated drone control to enhance the efficiency and reach of roadside assistance services, particularly in remote or difficult-to-access areas.

## System Components
The system is divided into several components, each residing in its own directory:

- `drone_control/`: Contains scripts for drone flight control and simulation of diagnostic tasks.
- `data_processing/`: Includes modules for collecting and analyzing real-time data from drones.
- `machine_learning/`: Features scripts for predictive maintenance and training models to anticipate vehicle issues.
- `communication/`: Manages all communication between drones and the server, ensuring robust data exchange.
